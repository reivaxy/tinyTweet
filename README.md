# tinyTweet


tinyTweet is going to be a small device including an esp-8266 and an oled screen.

After a configuration phase using the default "tinyTweet" SSID exposed and a minial web page providing a configuration form, tinyTweet will periodically fetch and display tweets according to key words or other selection means (lists, ...)

A few buttons will then allow to retweet or fav the displayed tweet.

I'm waiting for Twitter API key approval, for which I had to describe this to them. Hope they like it.
